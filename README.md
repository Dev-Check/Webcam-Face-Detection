# Webcam-Face-Detection
using a webcam from your laptop to detect your face using OpenCV tutorials and Cascade
This is a very simple program split for different tutorials on the OpenCV website located here https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d9/df8/tutorial_root.html
I'm looking to maybe import AI and Machine learning to also detect other objects and to output where it is located in either inches or meters if you have any tips or tutorials to help please PM me!
